A survey on AI-enabled safety and performance assurance for swarm UAV operations, bridging gaps for safer integration into civilian applications.

## Scope

- Reliability against system, component, and communication failures via fault tolerance, redundancy, and maintenance policies (k-out-of-n models, FMEA)
- Anomaly detection in motion (GPS/INS, statistical and ML methods) and communication (IDS, ConvNet-based)
- Swarm communication architectures — direct, indirect, ACL languages, centralized and distributed control
- Formation control schemes, route planning, obstacle avoidance
- Simulation and test/validation strategies

## Applications

Surveillance, delivery, search and rescue, urban air mobility.
