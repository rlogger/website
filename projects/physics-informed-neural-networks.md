Exploring how physics-based constraints can be embedded into neural network architectures to improve generalization and data efficiency.

## Overview

Traditional neural networks require large amounts of labeled data. By incorporating known physical laws as inductive biases, we can train models that respect conservation laws, symmetries, and other domain-specific constraints.

## Key Ideas

- Embedding PDEs as soft constraints in the loss function
- Architecture design that respects known symmetries
- Reduced data requirements through physics-informed regularization
