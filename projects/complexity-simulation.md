A collection of agent-based models and cellular automata exploring emergent behavior in complex systems.

## Highlights

- Conway's Game of Life variants with modified rulesets
- Schelling segregation model with continuous preferences
- Boids flocking simulation with predator-prey dynamics

## Tools

Built with Python and NumPy. Visualizations rendered with Matplotlib.
